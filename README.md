# GPIO-Interactive-Led-switch
This is a user-friendly switch to control leds plugged to the GPIO of the Raspberry Pi 3

The programming language I use is python.

In order to use the application, you will need to following hardware:

Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
breadboard
Male/Female jumper wires
6 LEDs (generic)
6 Resistors 330 ohm
Here are the GPIO pins we will be using and the colors they will correspond to:

BCM		Color		Physical placement

21		Left White			40
16		Yellow				36
12		Red					32
25		Blue				22
24		Green				18
13		Right White			33

The pins that can be used as Ground are 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34 and 39.

Please, give feedback on whether you find my app easy to use and what I can do to improve it.
