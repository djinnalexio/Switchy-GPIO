# GPIO-Led-switch

HI. This project is an interactive switch to control leds connected to a Raspberry pi 3 model B via GPIO.

The programming language I use is python.

In order to use the application, you will need to following hardware:
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
- breadboard
- Male/Female jumper wires
- LEDs (generic)
- Resistors 330 ohm

To setup your piece of hardware, you can follow this tutorial,https://www.hackster.io/user00317224/control-led-using-raspberry-pi-gpio-049a02?ref=part&ref_id=19713&offset=7

Also, I am using 6 LEDs with 5 different colors, but feel free to modify your copy to control the Leds you would like to use.

Please, give feedback on whether you find my app easy to use and what I can do to improve it.
