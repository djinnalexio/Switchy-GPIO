# GPIO-Interactive-Led-switch

HI. This project is an interactive switch to control leds connected to a Raspberry pi 3 model B via GPIO pins.

The programming language I use is python.

In order to use the application, you will need to following hardware:
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
- breadboard
- Male/Female jumper wires
- 6 LEDs (generic)
- 6 Resistors 330 ohm

Here are the GPIO pins we will be using and the colors they will correspond to:

BCM		Color			Physical placement

21		Left White		40
16		Yellow			36
12		Red				32
25		Blue			22
24		Green			18
17		Right White		11

The pins that can be used as Ground are 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34 and 39.

Please, give feedback on whether you find my app easy to use and what I can do to improve it.
